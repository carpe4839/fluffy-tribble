# QuickStart Guide: Creating an ePortfolio on Canvas

Follow this guide to learn how to create and share their ePortfolio on Canvas and create individual pages for the ePortfolio.

If you are enrolled in composition courses at the University of Washington, you are required to submit an ePortfolio on Canvas as your final project. In your ePortfolio, you will introduce three to four showcase pieces (your best assignments), discuss how you have improved as a writer during the course, and reflect upon how this course will help you with writing outside of class.

The ePortfolio is worth 70% of your final grade.
